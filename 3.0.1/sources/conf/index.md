# Configuration

oxd configuration consists of two files :

* `conf/oxd-conf.json` is the general configuration file for oxd, including where you add your license.
* `conf/oxd-default-site-config.json` is the fallback configuration file for the "Register site" command. See details on 
[Protocol page](../protocol/).

## oxd-conf.json

The contents of the configuration file is as follows:

```
oxd-conf.json
{
    "port":8099,
    "localhost_only":true,
    "time_out_in_seconds":0,
    "use_client_authentication_for_pat":true,
    "use_client_authentication_for_aat":true,
    "trust_all_certs":true,
    "trust_store_path":"",
    "trust_store_password":"",
    "license_id":"",
    "public_key":"",
    "public_password":"",
    "license_password":""
}
```

* port - oxd socket port
* localhost_only - flag to restrict communication
* time_out_in_seconds - time out for oxd socket (measured in seconds). oxd closes sockets automatically after this period of time (stops listen commands). Zero means listen indefinitely.
* use_client_authentication_for_pat - true if client authentication is required. If false than user authentication is performed which requires user_id and user_secret to be specified during the register_site command.
* use_client_authentication_for_aat - true if client authentication is required, if false than user authentication is performed which require user_id and user_secret specified during register_site command.
* trust_all_certs - true to trust all certificates, if false then trust_store_path must be specified to store with valid certificates
* trust_store_path - Path to Java .jks trust store to be used for an SSL connection.
* trust_store_password - password of trust store
* license_id - Will be supplied when you register for a license. 
* public_key - Will be supplied when you register for a license. It's very big--make sure you add it as one line with no spaces (if your mail client added line breaks).
* public_password - Will be supplied when you register for a license.
* license_password - Will be supplied when you register for a license.
