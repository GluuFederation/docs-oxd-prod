Description: Agrh, argparse!
        ===============
        
        Did you ever say "argh" trying to remember the details of optparse or argparse
        API? If yes, this package may be useful for you. It provides a very simple
        wrapper for argparse with support for hierarchical commands that can be bound
        to modules or classes. Argparse can do it; argh makes it easy.
        
        In a nutshell
        -------------
        
        Here's a list of features that `argh` adds to `argparse`:
        
        * mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before the parser
          is instantiated;
        * nesed commands made easy: no messing with subparsers (though they are of
          course used under the hood);
        * infer agrument type from the default value;
        * infer command name from function name;
        * add an alias root command ``help`` for the ``--help`` argument;
        * enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of a
          `argparse.Namespace` object.
        
        `Argh` is fully compatible with `argparse`. You can mix `argh`-agnostic and
        `argh`-aware code. Just keep in mind that `argh.dispatch` does some extra
        work that a custom dispatcher may not do.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
            $  pip install argh
        
        Example
        -------
        
        A very simple application with one command::
        
            @arg('text')  # signature is same as ArgumentParser.add_argument
            def echo(args):
                print args.text
            
            parser = ArghParser()
            parser.add_commands([echo])
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                parser.dispatch()
