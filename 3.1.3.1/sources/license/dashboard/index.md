# Dashboard

## License Information
The first part of the dashboard contains your oxd license details. Click `copy all license details` to copy all three pieces of information in a key-value pair or click on the individual keys to copy them. You will need to add your license details to your oxd configuration file in order to start the oxd server. 

If at any time you want to deactivate your license and all your active oxd installations, you can deactivate and reactivate your license by clicking on the button at the top right hand corner.

## Active Installations
This section of the dashboard shows the servers that have current oxd installations. Each time oxd is installed, the MAC address of the server is recorded and used to identify the server.

## Billing Administrators

This is a list of all users with access to your license account. You can invite new users as billing administrators in the invite users field. Just enter an email address and press enter to send them an invitation. An invite will be sent to their email prompting them to register and join your oxd account as a billing administrator.
