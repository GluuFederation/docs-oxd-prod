# Configuration

oxD configuration consists of two files :

* `conf/oxd-conf.json` - general configuration
* `conf/oxd-default-site-config.json` - fallback configuration for "Register site" command, see details on 
[Protocol page](https://oxd.gluu.org/docs/oxdserver/)

## oxd-conf.json

The contents of the configuration file is as follows:

```
oxd-conf.json
{
    "port":8099,
    "localhost_only":true,
    "time_out_in_seconds":0,
    "use_client_authentication_for_pat":true,
    "use_client_authentication_for_aat":true,
    "trust_all_certs":true,
    "trust_store_path":"",
    "trust_store_password":"",
    "license_id":"",
    "public_key":"",
    "public_password":"",
    "license_password":""
}
```

* port - oxD socket port
* localhost_only - flag to restrict communication
* time_out_in_seconds - time out for oxd socket in seconds. oxd closes sockets automatically after this time out (stops listen commands). Zero means listen indefinitely.
* use_client_authentication_for_pat - true if client authentication is required, if false than user authentication is performed which require user_id and user_secret specified during register_site command.
* use_client_authentication_for_aat - true if client authentication is required, if false than user authentication is performed which require user_id and user_secret specified during register_site command.
* trust_all_certs - true to trust all certificates, if false then trust_store_path must be specified to store with valid certificates
* trust_store_path - Path to Java .jks trust store to be used for an SSL connection.
* trust_store_password - password of trust store
* license_id - Will be supplied when you order a license.
* public_key - Will be supplied when you order a license. It's very big--make sure you it's one line with no spaces (if your mail client added line breaks).
