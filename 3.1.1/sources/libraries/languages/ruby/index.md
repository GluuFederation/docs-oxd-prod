# oxd-ruby

## Overview

Use oxd's Ruby library to send users from a Ruby application to your Gluu Server OpenID Connect Provider (OP) for dynamic enrollment, single sign-on (SSO), strong authentication, and access management policy enforcement. 


## Sample Project

Download a [Sample Project](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxd-ruby/archive/v3.1.1.zip) specific to this oxd-ruby library.


### System Requirements

- Ubuntu / Debian / CentOS / RHEL / Windows Server 2008 or higher
- Ruby 2.2
- Rails
- Passenger
- Apache 2.4.4 or higher
- oxd-ruby


## Prerequisites

### Required Software

To use the oxd-ruby library, you will need:

- A valid OpenID Connect Provider (OP), like the [Gluu Server](https://gluu.org/gluu-server) or Google.    
- An active installation of the [oxd-server](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/install/
) running on the same server as the client application.
- An active installation of the [oxd-https-extension](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/install/
) if oxd-https-extension connection is used. In this case, client applications can be on different servers but will be able to access oxd-https-extension.
- A Windows server or Windows installed machine / Linux server or Linux installed machine.


### Install oxd-ruby from RubyGems

The Ruby Client is installed using RubyGems. Include following line in the Gemfile of the application using the oxd-ruby library.

```
gem 'oxd-ruby', '~> 0.1.9'
```

Run the bundle command after to install the `oxd-ruby` plugin.

```
$ bundle install
```


### Configure the Client Application

- The configurations must be generated first using the following command.
```
$ rails generate oxd:config
```

  This command will install the `oxd_config.rb` initializer file in the `config/initializers` directory which contains all the global configuration options for the ruby plugin. The following configurations must be set before the plugin can be used.

  1. config.oxd_host_ip
  2. config.oxd_host_port
  3. config.op_host 
  4. config.authorization_redirect_uri

- Your client application must have a valid SSL certificate, so the URL includes: `https://`    
- The client hostname should be a valid `hostname`(FQDN), not a localhost or an IP address. You can configure the hostname by adding the following entry in the host file:

    **Linux**

    Host file location `/etc/host` :

    `127.0.0.1  client.example.com`  
    
    **Windows**

    Host file location `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host` :

    `127.0.0.1  client.example.com`
    
- Enable SSL by	adding the following lines on virtual host file of Apache in the location:

	**Linux**
    
    `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`
    
    **Windows**
    
    `C:/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`

```
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName client.example.com
    ServerAlias client.example.com
    DocumentRoot "<apache web root directory>"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    DocumentRoot "<apache web root directory>"
    ServerName client.example.com
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile "<Path to your ssl certificate file>"
    SSLCertificateKeyFile "<Path to your ssl certificate key file>"
    <Directory "<apache web root directory>">
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

    - [RP Get Claims Gathering URL](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/api/#uma-rp-get-claims-gathering-url) 


## Sample code

- [API Docs](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/oxd-ruby)

The plugin requires editing the `application_controller.rb` file to include the following snippet.

```
require 'oxd-ruby'

before_filter :set_oxd_commands_instance
protected
    def set_oxd_commands_instance
        @oxd_command = Oxd::ClientOxdCommands.new
    end
```


### OpenID Connect

#### Setup Client

In order to use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) for login, 
you need to setup your client application at the OpenID Connect Provider (OP). 
During setup, oxd will dynamically register the OpenID Connect 
client and save its configuration. Upon successful setup, the oxd-server will assign a unique oxd ID, return a Client ID and Client Secret. This Client ID and Client Secret can be used for `get_client_token` method. If your OpenID Connect Provider (OP) does not support dynamic registration (like Google), you will need to obtain a ClientID and Client Secret which can be passed to the `setup_client` method as a parameter. The Setup Client method is a one time task to configure a client in the oxd-server and OpenID Connect Provider (OP).

**Parameters:**

- authorization_redirect_uri: URL to which the OpenID Connect Provider (OP) is authorized to redirect the user to after authorization

#### Get Authorization URL

The `get_authorization_url` method returns the OpenID Connect Provider (OP) 
Authentication URL to which the client application must redirect the user to 
authorize the release of personal data. The Response URL includes state value, 
which can be used to obtain tokens required for authentication. This state value is used

### UMA (User Managed Access)

#### RS Protect

`uma_rs_protect` method is used for protecting resources by the Resource Server. The Resource Server is needed to construct the command which will protect the resource.
The command will contain an API path, HTTP methods (POST, GET and PUT) and scopes. Scopes can be mapped with authorization policy (uma_rpt_policies). If no authorization policy is mapped, uma_rs_check_access method will always return access as granted. For more information about uma_rpt_policies you can reference this [document](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/api/#uma-2-client-apis).

**Parameters:**

- oxd_id: oxd ID from client registration
- resources: One or more protected resources that a resource server manages, abstractly, as a set. In authorization policy terminology, a resource set is the "object" being protected. 
- protection_access_token: Generated from get_client_token method (Optional, required if oxd-https-extension is used)

**Request:**

```ruby
def protect_resources
    condition1_for_path1 = {:httpMethods => ["GET"], :scopes => ["https://scim-test.gluu.org/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/vas1/view"]}
    condition2_for_path1 = {:httpMethods => ["PUT", "POST"], :scopes => ["https://scim-test.gluu.org/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/vas1/all","https://scim-test.gluu.org/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/vas1/add"], :ticketScopes => ["https://scim-test.gluu.org/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/vas1/add"]}

    condition1_for_path2 = {:httpMethods => ["GET"], :scopes => ["https://scim-test.gluu.org/identity/seam/resource/restv1/scim/vas1/all"]}

    @uma_command.uma_add_resource("/photo", condition1_for_path1, condition2_for_path1) # Add Resource#1
    @uma_command.uma_add_resource("/document", condition1_for_path2) # Add Resource#2

    response = @uma_command.uma_rs_protect # Register above resources with UMA RS
    render :template => "uma/index", :locals => { :protect_resources_response => response }
end
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
    "status":"ok"
