# oxd-python

## Overview

Use oxd's Python library to send users from a Python application to your Gluu Server OpenID Connect Provider (OP) for dynamic enrollment, single sign-on (SSO), strong authentication, and access management policy enforcement. 


## Sample Project

Download a [Sample Project](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxd-python/archive/3.1.1.zip) specific to this oxd-python library.

### System Requirements

- Ubuntu / Debian / CentOS / RHEL / Windows Server 2008 or higher
- Python 2.7
- Flask
- oxdpython
- Flask-SSLify


## Prerequisites

### Required Software

To use the oxd-python library, you will need:

- A valid OpenID Connect Provider (OP), like the [Gluu Server](https://gluu.org/gluu-server) or Google.    
- An active installation of the [oxd-server](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/install/
) running on the same server as the client application.
- An active installation of the [oxd-https-extension](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/install/
) if oxd-https-extension connection is used. In this case, client applications can be on different servers but will be able to access oxd-https-extension.
- A Windows server or Windows installed machine / Linux server or Linux installed machine.


### Install oxdpython via pip

To install oxdpython via pip, run the following commands in the Linux terminal or Windows command window:

``` {.code }
pip install oxdpython
```

To install Flask-SSLify via pip, run the following commands in the Linux terminal or Windows command window:

``` {.code }
pip install Flask-SSLify
```


### Configure the Client Application

- Client application must have a valid SSL certificate, so the URL includes: `https://`    

    
- The client hostname should be a valid `hostname`(FQDN), not a localhost or an IP address. You can configure the hostname by adding the following entry in the host file:

    **Linux**

    Host file location `/etc/host` :

    `127.0.0.1  client.example.com`  
        
    **Windows**

    Host file location `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host` :

    `127.0.0.1  client.example.com`

- Open the downloaded [Sample Project](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxd-python/archive/3.1.1.zip) and navigate to the `demosite` directory inside the project.

- Enable SSL by	setting the valid certificate and key in your application startup file (demosite.py):

```{.code}
from flask_sslify import SSLify

app = Flask(__name__)
sslify = SSLify(app)

app.run('127.0.0.1', debug=True, port=8080, ssl_context=('<path>/demosite.crt', '<path>/demosite.key'))
```
- Run the following command to install oxdpython library:

``` {.code }
pip install oxdpython
```
- Run the following command to run the sample client application:
   
``` {.code }
python demosite.py
```

- With the oxd-server running, navigate to the URL's below to run the sample client application. To register a client in the oxd-server use the Setup Client URL. Upon successful registration of the client application, an oxd ID will be displayed in the UI. Next, navigate to the Login URL for authentication.

    - Setup Client URL: https://client.example.com:8080/setupClient
    - Login URL: https://client.example.com:8080
    - UMA URL: https://client.example.com:8080/uma

- The input values used during Setup Client are stored in the configuration file (demosite.cfg). Therefore, the configuration file needs to be writable by the client application.


!!! Note: 
    The [sample.cfg](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxd-python/blob/3.1.1/sample.cfg)
    file contains detailed documentation about the configuration values.

## Sample Code

### OpenID Connect

#### Setup Client

In order to use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) for login, 
you need to setup your client application at the OpenID Connect Provider (OP). 
During setup, oxd will dynamically register the OpenID Connect 
client and save its configuration. Upon successful setup, the oxd-server will assign a unique oxd ID, return a Client ID and Client Secret. This Client ID and Client Secret can be used for `get_client_token` method. If your OpenID Connect Provider (OP) does not support dynamic registration (like Google), you will need to obtain a ClientID and Client Secret which can be passed to the `setup_client` method as a parameter. The Setup Client method is a one time task to configure a client in the oxd-server and OpenID Connect Provider (OP).

**Parameters:**

- authorization_redirect_uri: URL to which the OpenID Connect Provider (OP) is authorized to redirect the user to after authorization
- op_host: URL of the OpenID Connect Provider (OP)

- contacts: (Optional) Array of e-mail addresses of people responsible for this client
- ui_locales: (Optional) End user's preferred languages and scripts for the user interface, represented as a space-separated list of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference
- claims_locales: (Optional) End user's preferred languages and scripts for claims being returned, represented as a space-separated list of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference
- client_id: (Optional) Client ID from OpenID Connect Provider (OP). Should be passed with the Client Secret.
- client_secret: (Optional) Client Secret from OpenID Connect Provider (OP). Should be passed with the Client ID.

identifier will be issued by the oxd-server. If your OpenID Connect Provider (OP) does not support dynamic registration (like Google), you will need to obtain a 
ClientID and Client Secret which can be passed to the `register_site` method as a 
parameter. The Register Site method is a one time task to configure a client in the 
oxd-server and OpenID Connect Provider (OP).

### UMA (User Managed Access)

#### RS Protect

`uma_rs_protect` method is used for protecting resources by the Resource Server. The Resource Server is needed to construct the command which will protect the resource.
The command will contain an API path, HTTP methods (POST, GET and PUT) and scopes. Scopes can be mapped with authorization policy (uma_rpt_policies). If no authorization policy is mapped, uma_rs_check_access method will always return access as granted. For more information about uma_rpt_policies you can reference this [document](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/api/#uma-2-client-apis).

**Parameters:**

- oxd_id: oxd ID from client registration
- resources: One or more protected resources that a resource server manages, abstractly, as a set. In authorization policy terminology, a resource set is the "object" being protected.

**Request:**

```python
resources = [

             }
         ]
         }
    ]
