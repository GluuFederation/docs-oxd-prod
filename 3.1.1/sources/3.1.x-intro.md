# What's New in oxd 3.1.x
We've made some significant updates to oxd server 3.1.1 to improve performance and functionality. 

## What's Changed

### Billing Model
* Whereas oxd 2.4.4 and 3.0.1 were licensed per server, **oxd 3.1.1 is licensed per application**.

* Pricing remains the same--USD $0.33/day/application. For example, if three applications (e.g. your website, CRM, BPM.) leverage your oxd 3.1.1 server, you will be charged USD $0.99 per day (3 apps * USD $0.33/day = USD $0.99). 

* Existing and/or new deployments of oxd 2.4.4 and 3.0.1 will continue to be billed per server.

* New or upgraded oxd 3.1.1 deployments will be subject to the new per application billing model.


## What's New

### oxd-https-extension
The addition oxd-https-extension allows for all your web applications to leverage one central oxd-server via HTTPS. Using a central oxd-server to service all your web applications reduces the time spent on installation and maintenance. This feature can be de-activated if you would like to use oxd-server locally.   

### UMA 2.0
Gluu is the first commercially supported IAM server to implement the [UMA 2.0 specification](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/oauth-uma-grant-2.0-05.html). UMA now aligns completely with OAuth 2.0. It also re-defines the claims gathering flow, enabling developers to implement multi-step consent, user-interactions, and stepped-up authentication flows. 

### SQL Database
oxd now supports in-memory or Redis caching of access tokens to improve throughput for OpenID Connect clients.  

!!! Note: 
    If you are upgrading from an older version of oxd, we have included an auto-migration script to easily transfer your           existing JSON files to your new oxd-server.  [Click Here](https://gluu.org/docs/oxd/3.1.1/upgrade/) for more details.
